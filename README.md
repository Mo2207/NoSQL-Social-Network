# NoSQL-Social-Network

## Description:
  
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
  - My motivation for this project was to learn how to use a noSQL database, in this case mongoDB. 
  - I built this application to get better at using mongoose.
